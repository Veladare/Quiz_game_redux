# Quiz Game Challenge
Deployed https://veladare.github.io/Quiz_game_redux/

## Description

The purpose of this project is to create a quiz that tests knowledge of students with coding questions. 

In completing this project, I learn how to use get element by ID, how to create a for loop that stores correct answers, how to create a leaderboard that save users score by using Json and localstorage, how to use event listeners to create dynamic buttons that change the page when clicked, and how to create a timer that deducts time when an incorrect answer is selected. 
## Installation 

N/A

## Usage

To begin the quiz, click on the begin quiz button and play through the game. After completing the quiz, the user can submit their score and view it by pressing the leaderboard button. If user wishes to play again, they can press on the replay button.  Users can wipe the leaderboard by selecting the clear leaderboard button if they wish also. 

To inspect the work and comments from the webpage, open it and right click on it. A window will open, then click inspect and a new tab will open which shows the structure of the webpage for individuals to review. Alternatively, the webpage can be inspect via Visual Studio code or similiar programs for review.
